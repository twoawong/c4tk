A psychotic patriot from the heart of America, the Soldier (allegedly Mister Jane Doe) is the bread and butter general assault unit of the team. While one of the easier to understand classes on the roster, he is far from the weakest. In fact, when played right, the Soldier can be one of the most dangerous classes on the battlefield. Equipped with his rocket launcher and stamina to spare, the Soldier is a highly versatile class for both offensive and defensive roles.
