Born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, the Scout is a fast-running scrapper with a baseball bat and a snarky 'in-your-face' attitude. He is the fastest mercenary on the battlefield. His Double Jump leaves slower opponents struggling to keep up and helps him navigate the terrain while dodging oncoming projectiles. Carrying a Scattergun, a Pistol, and a Bat, the Scout is ideal for aggressive fighting and flanking. The Scout is a great class for quick hit-and-run tactics for sapping away the enemies' health due to his ability to get in, do damage, and dash away before even being noticed.
