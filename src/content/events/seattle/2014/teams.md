        <p>
            Born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, the Scout is a fast-running scrapper with a baseball bat and a snarky 'in-your-face' attitude. He is the fastest mercenary on the battlefield. His Double Jump leaves slower opponents struggling to keep up and helps him navigate the terrain while dodging oncoming projectiles. Carrying a Scattergun, a Pistol, and a Bat, the Scout is ideal for aggressive fighting and flanking. The Scout is a great class for quick hit-and-run tactics for sapping away the enemies' health due to his ability to get in, do damage, and dash away before even being noticed.

        A psychotic patriot from the heart of America, the Soldier (allegedly Mister Jane Doe) is the bread and butter general assault unit of the team. While one of the easier to understand classes on the roster, he is far from the weakest. In fact, when played right, the Soldier can be one of the most dangerous classes on the battlefield. Equipped with his rocket launcher and stamina to spare, the Soldier is a highly versatile class for both offensive and defensive roles.

    <p>
        The Pyro is a mumbling pyromaniac of indeterminate origin who has a burning passion for all things fire related. The Pyro appears to be insane and delusional, living in a utopian fantasy world known as Pyroland. The Pyro specializes in fighting enemies at close range using a homemade Flame Thrower. Enemies set on fire suffer from afterburn and take additional damage over time, allowing the Pyro to excel at hit-and-run tactics. Due to the Flamethrowerâ€™s short range, the Pyro is weaker at longer ranges and relies heavily on ambushing and taking alternate routes to catch opponents off-guard.
