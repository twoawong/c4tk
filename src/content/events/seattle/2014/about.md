Code for the Kingdom is a weekend hackathon and ongoing ecosystem where global issues are tackled from a Christian perspective.

How can technology help alleviate and eradicate all forms of injustices, teach about God’s unconditional love, and build a healthier and stronger society?

This March, we want to develop new technologies to transform lives through a holistic Christian approach that combats social injustice, creates a culture of generosity, facilitates spiritual justice and unleashes the fullest capacity of each individual.

Code for the Kingdom is a weekend Hackathon where global issues are tackled with a Christian perspective. Join us at Seattle, WA as we battle the challenges confronting people all over the world.

          <h3>ENGAGING AND RELEASING OUR BEST</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Every person has something unique to contribute to the community, society, and church. Yet, less than 20% of us are actively engaged in doing what we could do. Most of us do not understand how we can leverage our skills and ideas to improve the lives of others.

What if we could discover how to use our unique gifts for God’s Kingdom? Build technologies to mobilize and equip every member of your community, church and family. Empower them to release their skills as well as to accelerate great ideas and initiatives that could transform the lives of the child or adult down your street.</p></section>

          <h3>SPIRITUAL JUSTICE</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Every person has the right to receive God’s Word and discover His unconditional love, because only God’s truth has the ability to transform the heart and the mind. Join forces with other like minded individuals and create technologies that help reduce spiritual poverty in every nation, city, community, family, and individual.

        
Build mobile applications to help children learn the Word of God, bury it in their hearts and share it with their friends. Create technologies for prayer, evangelism, mentorship, and other innovative means to spiritual formation.

          <h3>HELP CREATE A CULTURE OF GENEROSITY</h3>
        </header>
        <p>The Church and non-profits are always significantly underfunded. The Great Commission could be tremendously impacted and enhanced if financial resources were available. What better opportunity than this to cultivate generosity with Generis? Build fresh user experiences that can help organizations redefine the giving experience for their patrons.  Leverage the power of technology to encourage individuals and families to become generous to the causes and churches.
